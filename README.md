Collect marbles falling through lines of moving pins, rack up points and avoid the red!

Gameplay Guide: Guide the bucket with your mouse cursor to collect the falling marbles from above. Avoid collecting red marbles as they will cause damage, with large red marbles instantly killing you.

Point Guide: Grey (default) Marble = 3 points Blue (default) Marble = 6 points Green (default) Marble = 9 points 1 point per/second while alive

Technical Gameplay Information: Marble Cannon: The marble cannon will initially shoot every 3000ms (3 seconds). Every second in-game will reduce this Fire Rate until after a couple of minutes it will stop at a minimum Fire Rate of 200ms (0.2 seconds). The cannon will follow the X axis of the player (bucket) with limited speed. Pins: You will be introduced chronologically to the grey pin, blue pin, green pin and then red pin. Red will spawn 2x as much as green and blue, with all RGB pins spawning more as the score increases. Player (bucket): The bucket can only collect in the middle top of itself. The sides are hitboxed-off so marbles hitting the "rim" are possible. The bucket will follow the X axis of the mouse cursor with limited speed.
